## üéØ LLM Review Framework

### Review Criteria for Tradition Data

When reviewing and updating tradition data, focus on these areas:

#### 1. **Accuracy & Authenticity**
- Are core beliefs represented accurately?
- Do descriptions reflect mainstream understanding?
- Are there significant misrepresentations or oversimplifications?

#### 2. **Completeness**
- Are all four philosophical areas (metaphysics, epistemology, ethics, liberation) adequately covered?
- Are key concepts and practices included?
- Are important figures and texts listed?

#### 3. **Balance & Fairness**
- Are positive and challenging aspects both represented?
- Are critiques fair and scholarly rather than dismissive?
- Is the tradition presented in its own terms?

#### 4. **Source Quality**
- Are primary texts correctly identified?
- Do source links work and lead to reliable content?
- Are there better online resources available?

#### 5. **Consistency**
- Does the confidence score (0-1) accurately reflect source reliability?
- Are similar traditions described with comparable depth?
- Is terminology consistent across traditions?
