## üèóÔ∏è Data Structure Framework

### Core Philosophy Areas
Each tradition is analyzed across four fundamental philosophical dimensions:

#### 1. **Metaphysics** üß†
- **Ultimate Reality**: What exists at the deepest level?
- **View of World**: How is physical reality understood?
- **View of Self**: What is human nature and consciousness?
- **Afterlife**: What happens after death?

#### 2. **Epistemology** üìñ
- **Sources of Knowledge**: How do we know what we know?
- Examples: Scripture, reason, experience, revelation, intuition

#### 3. **Ethics** ‚öñÔ∏è
- **Moral Principles**: What makes actions right or wrong?
- **Virtue Systems**: What character traits should be cultivated?

#### 4. **Liberation/Salvation** ‚úàÔ∏è
- **Ultimate Goal**: What is the highest human aspiration?
- **Path/Method**: How do we achieve this goal?

  id: string;
  name: string;
  category: 'Religion' | 'Philosophy';
  subSchool: string;
  originDate: string;
  keyFigures: string[];
  adherents: string;
  confidence: number;        // 0-1 scale for data reliability

## üîó Source Integration

### Primary Text Links
The application integrates with major online repositories:
- **Archive.org** - Historical and religious texts
- **Wikisource** - Community-verified sources
- **Sacred-texts.com** - Religious and spiritual writings
- **Project Gutenberg** - Public domain philosophical works

### Adding New Sources

```json
{
  "Bible": [
    {
      "name": "King James Bible",
      "source": "Archive.org",
      "url": "https://archive.org/details/kingjamesbible",

    }
  ]
}
```

## üéØ LLM Review Framework

### Review Criteria for Tradition Data

When reviewing and updating tradition data, focus on these areas:

#### 1. **Accuracy & Authenticity**
- Are core beliefs represented accurately?
- Do descriptions reflect mainstream understanding?
- Are there significant misrepresentations or oversimplifications?

#### 2. **Completeness**
- Are all four philosophical areas (metaphysics, epistemology, ethics, liberation) adequately covered?
- Are key concepts and practices included?
- Are important figures and texts listed?

#### 3. **Balance & Fairness**
- Are positive and challenging aspects both represented?
- Are critiques fair and scholarly rather than dismissive?
- Is the tradition presented in its own terms?

#### 4. **Source Quality**
- Are primary texts correctly identified?
- Do source links work and lead to reliable content?
- Are there better online resources available?

#### 5. **Consistency**
- Does the confidence score (0-1) accurately reflect source reliability?
- Are similar traditions described with comparable depth?
- Is terminology consistent across traditions?

### Review Process

1. **Load Current Data**: Review existing tradition data in `src/data/json/traditions.json`
2. **Scholarly Verification**: Cross-check against academic sources and primary texts
3. **Source Enhancement**: Find better online links for primary texts and concepts
4. **Gap Analysis**: Identify missing information or incomplete sections
5. **Quality Improvement**: Suggest specific improvements for accuracy and completeness
6. **Documentation**: Update confidence scores and last-updated timestamps

### Improvement Suggestions Format

For each tradition, provide:
```
TRADITION: [Name]
ACCURACY: [Issues found / Corrections needed]
COMPLETENESS: [Missing information]
SOURCES: [Better links / Additional texts]
CONFIDENCE: [Recommended score with justification]
SPECIFIC CHANGES: [Detailed improvement suggestions]
```
